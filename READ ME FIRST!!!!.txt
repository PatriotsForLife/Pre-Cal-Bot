In this Pre Cal Bot folder there is a document that contains the Python code for my Python Discord Bot. This bot was built to answer Pre Calculus math provlems. This bot is something I made that shows a skill or talent I have. The document that contains the code is index.py. It is highly likely that you won't be able to open this file because you don't have a Python Interpreter that is why I will provide a link to my Github page that will allow you to loo at the code. Thank you.
